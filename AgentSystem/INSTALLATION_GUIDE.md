# AgentSystem Installation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides detailed instructions for installing and deploying AgentSystem, a multi-tenant SaaS platform designed for profit generation through AI capabilities and enterprise features. Follow the steps below to set up the system on your environment.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Python 3.8+**: Required for running the AgentSystem application.
- **Docker**: For containerized deployment and managing microservices.
- **Docker Compose**: For orchestrating multiple containers.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository if needed.
- **pip**: Python package manager for installing dependencies.

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux (Ubuntu recommended)
- **RAM**: Minimum 8 GB (16 GB recommended for production)
- **Disk Space**: At least 10 GB free space for installation and data storage
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor (4 cores recommended for production)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository (if not already downloaded)

If you haven't already obtained the AgentSystem codebase, clone it from the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd AgentSystem
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with necessary environment variables. A template is provided as `.env.example`. Customize it based on your setup:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to set up API keys, database credentials, and other configuration settings.

### 3. Install Python Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Database Setup

AgentSystem uses a multi-tenant database architecture. Set up the database by running the provided SQL scripts:

```bash
python database/setup.py
```

This script will initialize the database schema for tenant isolation and other necessary tables.

### 5. Docker Deployment (Recommended for Production)

For a production environment, use Docker Compose to deploy the system with all microservices:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml up -d
```

This command will start all necessary containers including the main application, load balancer, and other services.

### 6. Running in Development Mode

For development or testing purposes, you can run the application directly:

```bash
python main.py --mode interactive
```

Use `--mode server` for server mode or `--mode task` for running specific tasks.

### 7. Configuration

Adjust configuration settings in `config/` directory files or through environment variables to customize the system behavior, such as AI provider settings, scaling rules, etc.

### 8. Accessing the System

- **Interactive Mode**: Directly interact with the system via the command line.
- **Server Mode**: Access the API endpoints at `http://<host>:<port>` (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).
- **Dashboard**: View system metrics and analytics at `/dashboard` endpoint if enabled.

## Post-Installation

- **Initial Setup**: Complete the onboarding flow to set up tenant accounts and initial configurations.
- **Monitoring**: Use the real-time dashboard to monitor system performance and scaling activities.
- **Updates**: Regularly check for updates or use the automated update feature if configured.

## Troubleshooting

- **Common Issues**: Check logs in `logs/` directory for detailed error messages.
- **Database Connection Errors**: Ensure database credentials in `.env` are correct and the database server is accessible.
- **Docker Issues**: Verify Docker and Docker Compose are installed correctly and have necessary permissions.
